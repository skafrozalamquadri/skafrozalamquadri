👋 Hi, I’m @skafrozalamquadri!

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, statistics, and using data to derive valuable insights and make informed decisions. I enjoy working with data, visualizing it, and discovering patterns and trends that can lead to actionable conclusions.

🌱 I’m currently learning various data analysis techniques, programming languages like Python and R, and tools like SQL and Excel to manipulate and analyze data efficiently. I'm also familiarizing myself with data visualization libraries and data cleaning methods to ensure data quality.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects where I can apply my skills and learn from others. I'm open to working on real-world datasets and exploring different domains such as business analytics, market research, or social data analysis.
